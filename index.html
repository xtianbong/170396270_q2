        I wake up and slap the half broken beer bottle from last night
        I let out a soft yelp  It doesn't really hurt, but now
        I have to clean the wound. 
        <br>
        <br>
        When I finish cleaning up, I go on my phone to waste a little time
        before work. I always wake up a little early do do just that.
        Today however, before I can get to Twitter, I am blasted in the face
        by my weather.com widget telling me it is not in fact the ususal 6 am,
        it was 11 pm.
