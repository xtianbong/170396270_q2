            They say to <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dress_for_the_slide,_not_the_ride">dress for the slide, not the ride.</a> And now
            I know what they mean. Jeans got split on the right knee and scraped my knee quite badly. My coat was even worse. the sleave had a slit all the way to elbow. It was upon 
            examinig this tear that I realised the coat was not mine. This was Aaron's new under armor coat. I've been borrowing it since he's visiting his parents. It's a $500 coat 
            and I had no clue hoe i WAS TO pay for it, especially since I had probably lost my job at Burger Man(tm). I checked my board, and the reason I fell was that my rear wheel bearings
            were completely broken. I could not even find the right wheel. 
        </p>

        <p>
            I left my board on the side of the road, and started the walk home. I had given up, I just wanted to go to bed early and start afresh the next day. I took the scenic route home to think about things. As
            I trugged back, holding the cuff of the tartered coat with my left hand. I caught the smell of earth and fresh grenades. I find myself there almost instinctively and come to in front of a 
            grape stand. I hand the nice lady behind it a fiver and she drops two bunches of them in my open knapsack. I kept a third one in my gloved hand for convenience. I barely make it a block from the stand when I 
            am compeled to eat one of the, to my knowlege,  unwashed grapes.
        </p>
        The grape was good
        <br>
        It wasn't so bad
        <br> 
        Thank you grape
