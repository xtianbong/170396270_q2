            The alarm clock that I know and hate had fallen victim to one of the power outages that were all too common
            in the past few weeks. I know I should just use my phone for this, but I hate all the built in alarm songs
            and I can't be asked to download any. I like my old fashioned non functioning clock, and it's my right.

            I grab a sport coat and my long board, slap on some sneakers and I'm out the door. I'm in the bike lane pushing with the 
            might of 10 men going at easily 30 km/h down the familiar hill. All of a sudden, my rear wheels violently slide to the
            right, violently throwing me off the board. Luckily I aim for the grass as I hit the floor, and protect my head the way 
            <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hundbrub8iQ">braille skateboarding</a> taught me.

            Even that did not save my clothes though.
